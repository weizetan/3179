      <h1>Redefining<br><span>HAPPINESS</span>  in 2022</h1>
      <hr>
      <p> Welcome to the <span class="highlight">2022 World Happiness Report</span>. This report explores happiness worldwide. 
         It looks at how happy different countries are and why.
         We collect data from <span class="highlight">146 countries</span> to understand what makes people happy. 
         <br> We measure happiness on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 represents the unhappiest and 10 the happiest. 
         This measurement is based on factors like money, support from others, health, freedom, 
         fairness, and kindness. Governments and organizations use this information to make decisions 
         that can improve people's lives. So, let's dive into the happiness of the world in 2022!</p>

      <p class="p1">It's interesting to observe that <span class="highlight">Finland</span> leads among those countries with the <span class="highlight">highest</span> happiness score, 
                    indicating that its residents enjoy more overall wellbeing and life satisfaction than those in other 
                    nations throughout the world.</p>

      <div id="spaceline"></div>
      <p class="p1">We have identified six key factors that contribute to <span class= "highlight">Happiness Score</span> :<br>
         <br>
         1. <span class="highlight_GDP">GDP per capita</span><br>
         2. <span class="highlight_social">Social Support</span><br>
         3. <span class="highlight_life">Healthy Life Expectancy</span><br>
         4. <span class="highlight_freedom">Freedom of Life Choices</span><br>
         5. <span class="highlight_generosity">Generosity</span><br>
         6. <span class="highlight_perception">Perceptions of Corruption</span> <br>
         <br>
         These factors play a significant role in determining a country's overall happiness, with economic well-being, 
         social support, health, freedom, generosity, and trust all contributing to the overall happiness level.<br></p>
      
      <div id="spaceline"></div>

      <div id="scatterplot1"></div>

      <p class="p1">By carefully examining the graph above, we can see that <span class="highlight_GDP">GDP per capita </span>
         is within the greatest range, indicating that it has a considerable impact on how the happiness score 
         is determined.
      </p>

      <div id="spaceline"></div>
      
      <div id="container1">
         <div class="first">
            <p class="p2">We can observe that the first four factors (<span class="highlight_GDP">GDP per capita</span>, <span class="highlight_social">Social Support</span>, <span class="highlight_life">Healthy Life Expectancy</span>, 
               and <span class="highlight_freedom">Freedom of Life Choices</span>) exhibit a similar data pattern. All the data points for these factors are situated 
               at the higher end of their respective trend lines, indicating a strong positive correlation. In simpler terms, when 
               these factors are higher, the happiness score tends to be higher as well.
               <br>
               <br>On the other hand, <span class="highlight_perception">Perceptions of Corruption</span> stands out from these four factors. Its data points are located at 
               the lower end of the trend line, suggesting a negative correlation. In other words, when perceptions of corruption are 
               lower, happiness scores tend to be higher.
               <br>
               <br>For <span class="highlight_generosity">Generosity</span>, the trend line is nearly horizontal, indicating a weak correlation with happiness scores. 
               In simple terms, there isn't a strong connection between generosity and happiness scores based on this data.</p>
