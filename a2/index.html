         <p class="p1"> Welcome to the <span class="highlight">2022 World Happiness Report</span>. 
            This report explores happiness worldwide. 
            It looks at how happy different countries are and why.
            We collect data from <span class="highlight">146 countries</span> to understand what makes people happy. 
            <br> We measure happiness on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 represents the unhappiest and 10 the happiest. 
            This measurement is based on factors like money, support from others, health, freedom, 
            fairness, and kindness. Governments and organizations use this information to make decisions 
            that can improve people's lives. So, let's dive into the happiness of the world in 2022!</p>

         <p class="title1">Measurement of Happiness Score :</p>
 
         <p class="p1">We have identified six key factors that contribute to <span class= "highlight">Happiness Score</span> which are <br>
            <br>
            1. <span class="highlight_GDP">GDP per capita</span><br>
            2. <span class="highlight_social">Social Support</span><br>
            3. <span class="highlight_life">Healthy Life Expectancy</span><br>
            4. <span class="highlight_freedom">Freedom of Life Choices</span><br>
            5. <span class="highlight_generosity">Generosity</span><br>
            6. <span class="highlight_perception">Perceptions of Corruption</span> <br>
            <br>
            These factors play a significant role in determining a country's overall happiness, with economic well-being, 
            social support, health, freedom, generosity, and trust all contributing to the overall happiness level.<br></p>
 
         
         <div id="scatterplot1"></div>

         <p class="p1">By carefully examining the graph above, we can see that <span class="highlight_GDP">GDP per capita </span>
            is within the greatest range, indicating that it has a considerable impact on how the happiness score 
            is determined.
         </p>

         <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-3" style="margin-right: 55px;">
               <p class="p2" >We can observe that the first four factors (<span class="highlight_GDP">GDP per capita</span>, <span class="highlight_social">Social Support</span>, <span class="highlight_life">Healthy Life Expectancy</span>, 
                  and <span class="highlight_freedom">Freedom of Life Choices</span>) exhibit a similar data pattern.They are positively correlated with happiness scores, meaning that when these factors are higher, happiness tends to be higher too.
                  <br>
                  <br>On the contrary, <span class="highlight_perception">Perceptions of Corruption</span> differs from these four factors. It has a negative correlation, meaning that when perceptions of corruption are lower, happiness scores tend to be higher.
                  <br>
                  <br>For <span class="highlight_generosity">Generosity</span>, has a weak correlation with happiness scores, meaning there isn't a strong link between generosity and happiness based on this data.</p>
